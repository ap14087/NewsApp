News App is a simple news app which uses NewsAPI to fetch top news headlines from the API. 
The codebase focuses on following key things:

Code structuring, style and comments
Offline first 
Kotlin + Coroutines
And tests 
The idea is to keep the app simple and use new libraries and tools which makes it easier to build high quality Android applications.
